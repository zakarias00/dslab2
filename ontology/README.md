# Ontology Directory

This folder contains resources related to the ontology used in this project. Ontologies are used to define a set of representational primitives, such as classes, properties, and relationships, that model the domain knowledge in a structured way.

## Contents

This directory may include:

- **Ontology Files**: These files define the structure, relationships, and rules of the domain knowledge.
- **Schemas**: If applicable, schemas that validate the ontology structure.
- **Documentation**: Notes or guides on how to use, update, or extend the ontology.

## Usage

1. **Loading the Ontology**: Describe how to load the ontology into the relevant tools or applications in your project.
2. **Updating the Ontology**: State any rules or methods for maintaining/updating the ontology files.
3. **Integrations**: If the ontology interacts with code or databases in the project, outline these integrations here.
