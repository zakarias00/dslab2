"Very Large, Distributed Data Volumes","Course content Data privacy has a significant overlap with information security. Importantly, information security is a prerequisite for privacy. Furthermore, many organizational techniques from information security are applicable to maintaining data privacy. However, data privacy also differs from information security in significant ways. One of these lies in the focus on control of inferences from given data and information. This course is centered on introducing quantitative theory for this inference control often referred to as statistical disclosure control. We will discuss formal definitions of privacy in databases containing population data. In particular, we will contrast syntactic and differential privacy and their respective suitability for balancing privacy costs with information benefits. We will spend significant time studying differentially private algorithms for querying data. In addition, we will discuss ethical and political arguments for why privacy is needed and discuss the framing of privacy in terms of a tradeoff between individual privacy and societal benefit. In this context, we will critique current popular technical and regulatory approaches to data privacy from a quantitative theory perspective. According to the UN declaration of human rights, privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy reduces information asymmetries and therefore reduces inequalities in power between individuals and corporations and other institutions, reduces possibilities for persecution, allows dissent, and is intrinsically connected to democracy. As such it touches on a multitude of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, including gender equality (5), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (9), Reduced Inequalities (10), Sustainable Cities and Communities (11), and Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16). Learning outcome Knowledge: The successful student will have an advanced understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of data privacy. She will be able to relate this understanding to areas ranging from the philosophical, through the political and organizational, to the technical. In particular, she will know privacy as a process of adapting to a changing circumstance and understand the significance of randomness in protecting privacy and quantifying risk, and be able to operationalize this understanding.

Design of Cyber-Physical Systems,"Course content The course discusses the construction of efficient and dependable software solutions for distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS), with the use of formal specifications expressed in the language UML. It consists of six major units: State Machines: The syntax, semantics, and realizability of executable state machines are discussed. Implementation Design: Here, one learns how given specifications can be mapped to physical components. Further, one should understand how state machines can be used to support certain hardware needs. Software Design: Patterns and methods necessary to create event-driven software will be taught including internal organization and interface issues of software components. Cyber-Physical Systems: The basics of cyber-physical systems will be introduced. This includes ways supporting the management of these systems that often produce a vast amount of data. In particular, interesting communication architectures and protocols are discussed. Development of IoT and ITS Systems: The ""Internet of Things"" and ""Intelligent Transportation Systems"" are two important application domains for CPS. The students will learn technologies to create such systems that often have to guarantee stringent real time and safety properties. The learned knowledge will be deepened by the design of a larger example system. Testing: The students should learn about the main ideas and techniques for testing systems. Learning outcome A.

Fundamentals of Ethical Hacking,"This course covers testing of software. Besides basic foundations, this includes both dynamic testing where the software under test is executed and static approaches where software and other artefacts produced during software development are investigated without executing them. The focus of this course is, however, on dynamic testing. The different levels of testing (component test, integration test, system and acceptance test) and types of testing (functional, non-functional, structural and change-related) are covered as well as different test design techniques (black box test and white box test). Furthermore, test management and principles of test tools are discussed. In addition, selected advanced topics may be covered (for example, test languages, testing of object-oriented software, test process improvement, agile testing). The covered topics are a superset of the International Software Testing Qualifications Board's (ISTQB) certified tester foundation level syllabus. The first part of the course is based on flipped-classroom style weekly reading, videos and assignments. In the second part, students work independently on some project related to software testing. Note: while this is an ""M"" course, it is rather on MSc. level. BSc. students who take this course need to be very advanced in their BSc. studies, i.e. have experience in programming languages, software development and applying it in some software project, but should also be familiar with theoretical concepts from automata theory. Also, BSc. students should not take this course, if they know that they are going to continue with MSc. studies, because they might then experience a lack of suitable courses in their MSc. studies. Learning Outcomes: After completing the course, students are able to perform basic software testing activites. In particular, they are able to Explain what testing is, why testing is necessary, and how a test process looks like. Explain the different test levels and test types and apply the corresponding strategies based on the analysis of the test object. Explain, choose and apply static techniques to evaluate software artefacts. Explain, choose and apply test design techniques to create cases based on the analysis on relevant base documents. Explain test management activities. Classify test tools, explain their advantages and disadvantages, and create the required input for using at least one test tool. Explain or apply the advanced topics (for example, regression testing, test languages, testing of object-oriented software, automatic test generation) that may have been covered in the course.

Design of Digital Platforms,"The course ""design of digital platforms"" aims to give the student insight into what a digital platform is through an overview of the different design steps and important design decisions in the development of a digital platform. Digital platforms make the connection between an application (e.g. multimedia) and the realization into embedded systems. The selection of a digital platform is essential in the design of electronic systems. After this course, the students should be able to: explain the different steps and abstraction levels in the design process of a digital platform; explain the impact of a low-level design decision on the system level performance parameters, being latency, throughput, area, energy efficiency and flexibility; to discuss the trade-offs between these parameters; to derive a control flow graph and data flow graph for simple algorithms; be able to implement a simple signal processing algorithm on an embedded processor and/or hardware accelerator, using data and control flow graphs. be able to compute and optimize the delay and energy consumption of a simple gate-level circuit; explain the differences between available digital platforms and choose the best suited platform for a given application; assess the impact of technology scaling on the future of digital platform performance; These goals are pursues through 3 activities: Lectures: teaching theories, accompanied by small written exercises. Exercise sessions: used to introduce the different design tools and design environments used during the design seminar. They make the link between theory and practice. Design seminar: in this part a design is made from specifications to implementation into an embedded system by means of HW/SW co-design. Students should have basic knowledge of CMOS digital logic. They should be able to design simple combinatorial and sequential circuits. They should have experience with a hardware description language (Verilog, VHDL or other). For the design seminar, they should also be familiar with a low level software language (e.g. C). The lecture series of the course ""design of digital platforms"" contains the following topics: Design of digital integrated circuits: translation from specificaties to implementation Different abstraction levels: design tasks, terminology and design environments Design goals: area, throughput, delay, power, energy, flexibility (HW/SW trade-off) Data flow graph and control flow graph: definition and usage during design of digital platforms HW/SW co-design Gate level design for low power and for low energy Usage of transformations at the algorithmic and hardware level to reach design goals Large variation of digital platforms for embedded systems Impact from technology scaling on digital platform design and selection. The exercise sessions are used to introduce hardware description language, software description language and a design environment. During the exercise sessions, the students will practice with these description languages and design environments, so that they are ready to use  them in the design seminar. During the design seminar, the students will learn hands-on to select the best digital platform for a given application. It consists of the following steps: Step 1: the given application is implemented on a small micro-controller in software. This will typically be C on an 8-bit or 16-bit micro-controller. Its SW performance is measured. Step 2: the C-version is further optimized in assembly if the performance goals are not reached. This task will give them insight into performance losses due to software compilers. Step 3: students will make a HW/SW co-design project. A dedicated hardware block, either as co-processor, or instruction set extension, is made for the time critical parts of the application. Since there is a large design space, students have to choose themselves the split between HW and SW, based on the performance results obtained in the previous steps. Step 4: HW/SW co-simulation of the final design is made. And if time permits, it is downloaded on an FPGA. Step 5: Students have to present their design to their fellow students. Important trade-offs, design decisions and critical evaluation are discussed.",the course design of digital platforms aims to give the student insight into what a digital platform is through an

Software for Real-Time Control,"Here are three reasons why you might want to take this course: First, as engineer you will be designing, implementing, or managing electronic systems and services that in most cases have privacy implications. For example, ambient sensors and biomedical implants collect, process, store, and communicate (sometimes highly sensitive) data related to individuals; the data generated by ubiquitous electronic communications provides detailed insight into people’s activities and lifestyle; and the personalization of multimedia applications and services relies on learning about individuals’ most intimate preferences and adapting to them. The first objective (O1) of the course is that you are able to identify the privacy concerns that arise in different scenarios. For example, if you are designing a new video-on-demand service for mobile phones, what could go wrong for your future users’ privacy? The second objective (O2) is that you are able to relate privacy concerns to technical design choices. For example, what privacy risks arise from relying on unique identifiers? or from centralizing the storage and processing of data? Privacy technologies aim to mitigate privacy concerns. The third objective (O3) is that you understand the principles underlying the design of privacy technologies. For example, anonymity technologies require diversity (of users, uses, attributes, internet subnets, etc.); advanced cryptographic protocols enable sophisticated services (e.g., smart metering) while minimizing the disclosure of data beyond what seems intuitively possible; and differential privacy ensures that queries to database of personal records cannot be used to determine if a particular individual record is included in the database. Second, you will deal with privacy issues not only as an engineer but also as an individual and as a member of society. As an individual, you use a variety of services: mobile communications, online shopping, search engines such as Google, social media such as Facebook or Twitter, etc. The fourth objective of this course (O4) is that you become aware of what privacy issues are associated to the use of different services, what are your basic (legal) rights concerning privacy and data protection, and what technologies you can use to mitigate your exposure to privacy risks. As a result of this, you will be able to form your own informed opinions on how privacy issues should be addressed in our increasingly technological society. Many of these privacy issues are at the heart of ongoing debates whose outcome will have an influence on how society is shaped: Is the tracking of Internet users necessary for the economic sustainability of the Internet? Might profiling and personalization lead to social sorting and discrimination? Should certain content be censored? Should we have real name policies in social media to combat harassment? Should user communications be stored for long periods of time for the purpose of law-enforcement investigations? Are we building an unprecedented mass surveillance infrastructure, or are overblown privacy concerns an obstacle to data-driven innovation? Finally, the course is heavily based on recent research. By participating in this course you will get a first hand experience of what research is like. The sixth objective (O5) is that you learn to read scientific articles, as well as to develop and present your own ideas. This course provides an introduction to privacy technologies. We will explain the various types of privacy risks and introduce a range of existing privacy technologies that address these risks. These include: cryptographic protocols with applications to privacy, including: private information retrieval, oblivious transfer, anonymous e-cash, anonymous authentication, and private search. privacy engineering, including: privacy in agile frameworks, introduction to anonymous communication systems. database privacy & data anonymization, including: k-anonymization, re-identification algorithms, and differential privacy. ML/AI privacy, including: privacy preserving ML/AI and ML/AI for privacy. web privacy, including: web tracking techniques, cookies, device fingerprinting. legal aspects of privacy, including: GDPR and Human Rights legal frameworks. There will be four exercise sessions in total. Session 1: Privacy scandals session (1 point) In this session students give a presentation (of a few minutes) on a privacy scandal of their choice. To prepare for this session, the student must search online news and documentation of a high-profile incident of the last year that violated the privacy of a person or a group of people. Examples of incidents may include data breaches, unlawful data saring/use practices by organizations, or any other event. During the session the student should explain the story of the incident, the reasons (e.g., some security vulnerability), and the consequences. Sessions 2 & 3: Assignment feedback sessions (no points) In these two sessions students work in groups of about 4 people. Each student takes about half an hour to explain to the others in the group the topic they have chosen for their assignment and their approach to addressing that problem. Students discuss and give feedback to each other on their respective assignments. Session 4: Assignment presentation session (4 points) In this session students will have a few minutes to present their assignment to the lecturers and TAs of the course, who may ask questions and give feedback to the students. The students will still have some days to finalize the assignment incorporating the received feedback and addressing issues identified during the presentation.

Distributed Systems,"The course aims to familiarize students with distributed systems through a thorough study of architectures, algorithms and protocols used in distributed systems. Furthermore, students meet development and execution environments for distributed software. Based on the experience students gain from this, a more thorough insight is build in the challenges and solutions with the realization and usage of distributed software systems. The studied platforms illustrate the state of affairs and are used to map research challenges. The student should possess sufficient knowledge on computer networks, should have had an introduction in operating systems and in object-oriented programming. In a first step, attention will go to the architecture of distributed systems and to the non-functional demands that are often made. Next to this, the communication middleware will be dealt with extensively and as well as a number of classic distributed systems: file systems, name administrators. Next, a number of distributed algorithms will be discussed in detail: reciprocal exclusion, elections, global condition and transactions. In these practical sessions, students familiarize themselves with about three (so-called middleware) platforms for distributed software. The first step is usually getting to know the basic functioning and principles of such platforms. In one more steps following this, students are asked to solve a simple and representative problem using this platform. The solution can consist of a design, a limited implementation or both. Similar solutions are used as guidelines for a number of exam questions. There are 3 practical sessions. For most exercises, proposed solutions should be handed in temporarily at the end of the supervised session, and a definitive version at the and of the week in which the practical session is planned.",the course aims to familiarize students with distributed systems through a thorough study of architectures algorithms and protocols used in distributed systems furthermore students meet development and execution environments for distributed software based on the experience students gain from this a more thorough insight is build in the challenges and solutions with the realization and usage of distributed software systems the studied platforms illustrate the state of affairs and are used to map research challenges the student should possess sufficient knowledge on computer networks should have had an introduction in operating systems and in objectoriented programming in a first step attention will go to the architecture of distributed systems and to the nonfunctional demands that are often made next to this the communication middleware will be dealt with extensively and as well as a number of classic distributed systems file systems name administrators next a number of distributed algorithms will be discussed in detail reciprocal exclusion elections global condition and transactions in these practical sessions students familiarize themselves with about three socalled middleware platforms for distributed software the first step is usually getting to know the basic functioning and principles of such platforms in one more steps following this students are asked to solve a simple and representative problem using this platform the solution can consist of a design a limited implementation or both similar solutions are used as guidelines for a number of exam questions there are 3 practical sessions for most exercises proposed solutions should be handed in temporarily at the end of the supervised session and a definitive version at the and of the week in which the practical session is planned,"algorithms, computer networks, file systems, objectoriented programming oop, operating systems, session computer science, software systems, communication","distributed systems, the course aims to familiarize students with distributed systems through a thorough study of architectures, algorithms and protocols used in distributed systems furthermore, students meet development and execution environments for distributed software based on the experience students gain from this, a more thorough insight is build in the challenges and solutions with the realization and usage of distributed software systems the studied platforms illustrate the state of affairs and are used to map research challenges the student should possess sufficient knowledge on computer networks, should have had an introduction in operating systems and in objectoriented programming in a first step, attention will go to the architecture of distributed systems and to the nonfunctional demands that are often made next to this, the communication middleware will be dealt with extensively and as well as a number of classic distributed systems file systems, name administrators next, a number of distributed algorithms will be discussed in detail reciprocal exclusion, elections, global condition and transactions in these practical sessions, students familiarize themselves with about three socalled middleware platforms for distributed software the first step is usually getting to know the basic functioning and principles of such platforms in one more steps following this, students are asked to solve a simple and representative problem using this platform the solution can consist of a design, a limited implementation or both similar solutions are used as guidelines for a number of exam questions there are 3 practical sessions for most exercises, proposed solutions should be handed in temporarily at the end of the supervised session, and a definitive version at the and of the week in which the practical session is planned, algorithms, computer networks, file systems, objectoriented programming oop, operating systems, session computer science, software systems, communication"
Advanced Methods in Cryptography,"This course gives a thorough introduction to more advanced topics in modern cryptography, encompassing proper security models, cryptanalysis, and implementations attacks. The course deals with analytical methods and concepts in modern cryptography and how these can influence not only the design, but also the use and implementation of cryptosystems.  The selected topics are as follows: Cryptanalytic algorithms determine largely the design and parameter choice of cryptographic algorithms Provable security introduces the different modern definitions of encryption security / signature algorithm and shows why such strong definitions are necessary Implementation attacks make use of information that leaks during the execution of an algorithm, such as time or power usage, to reconstruct the secret key. These attacks influence especially the way the cryptographic algorithms should be implemented. FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) are two recent technologies that allow us to compute on encrypted data in a privacy preserving manner, i.e. without leaking any information about the underlying data. Post-quantum cryptography exemplifies the threat posed by quantum computers and how these can be mitigated by novel cryptographic schemes. Following this course enables the student to make a first security analysis of a new cryptographic algorithm and to determine to which modern security definitions it conforms. This course bridges abstract discrete mathematics and these security analyses, and will therefore be taught from both points of view. Skills: the student should be able to analyze, synthesize and interpret Knowledge: basic knowledge of algebra (e.g. H01G5A), knowledge of cryptography and network security (e.g. H05D9A/H05E1A) is useful, but not necessary. The course consists of lectures covering the following topics: Symmetric key cryptanalysis: Differential cryptanalysis,  linear cryptanalysis, design of block ciphers Public key constructions: Elliptic curve integrated encryption scheme, digital signature algorithm, full domain hash Symmetric key constructions: Modes of operation, MAC functions, AEAD constructions. Provable security & security models for encryption and signatures: perfect, semantic, polynomial security, passive, chosen ciphertext, adaptive chosen ciphertext attack; selective, existential forgeries, Fiat-Shamir transformation Fully homomorphic encryption: homomorphic encryption, applications and limitations, integer-based encryption scheme, Gentry’s construction, bootstrapping

Hadoop technologies. Given the eminently practical nature of the course and its semi-presential nature, its development will be organized in a series of theoretical sessions in which students will acquire the knowledge related to the design and implementation of a cloud infrastructure for the management and processing of massive data. A good part of the theoretical sessions are carried out following the “flipped classroom” methodology. Information will be provided to students for individual work. In this way, each student will dedicate the time required to review the contents in order to reach an understanding of them. The time in the classroom will be dedicated to posing practical cases that will be solved collaboratively, clarifying doubts and solving comprehension or learning difficulties. During the course, students will have to design and implement solutions for the different projects that are presented to them and that cover practically all the contents of the course. In these projects, students must deploy and install the appropriate virtual machines and configure the corresponding services to solve basic ""big data"" problems. A feedback system is proposed at several levels: Group feedback in theory sessions and in smaller groups in practice based on the solutions proposed to practical cases and projects. The advice received can also be applied to subsequent tasks (feed-forward). Individual feedback in practical sessions, based on individual correction of the projects carried out. This correction is carried out through a dialogic process. AI can be used as a first approximation to search for information and possible solutions to the cases raised, as well as examples of use. However, it is necessary to critically analyse the responses, contrasting the information, to reach a creative result that allows learning and avoids some of the problems derived from the use of AI.

Advanced Network Security,"Objectives The purpose of this course is to become familiar with how system vulnerabilities arise on the software layer and how to protect against them. At the end of the course, the students - have a deep understanding of the fundamental limitations in software security and based on that can argue about the feasibility and effectiveness of practical techniques to find weaknesses. - understand the fundamental root causes of software errors and the costs of the techniques to find them. - should know and understand the most important security weaknesses in practice as well as effective techniques to avoid them. These techniques range from a defensive choice of programming language to analytic techniques like static code analysis, fuzzing, and formal verification. - should be able to apply countermeasures appropriately to mitigate weaknesses. - use a wholistic approach (7+1 kingdoms) to finding security weaknesses that covers all aspects of a system and use that to decompose complex application scenarios.. - come up with original solutions to weaknesses.  This course consistst of a series of lectures that focus on the most important ideas in Software Security. Correspondingly the focus is on concepts and not practical application. This course is not a lab. Background knowledge in cryptography is helpful. Content ‘Cryptography is typically bypassed, not penetrated', Adi Shamir famously said. In fact most security problems are not due to weak cryptography but happen when systems get implemented in software. Bugs are common in all kinds of software, but in the adversarial setting of security, software attackers may be able to cause bugs like buffer overflows that otherwise happen with negligible probability simply because they can craft the input that the system operates on. Such bugs cannot be found with regular testing methods. This course covers software insecurity as well as software security, because it is necessary to understand the attack side in order to build defenses. On the attack side the course covers typical implementation errors such as memory corruption and web attacks and how they can be exploited. Some root causes for software insecurity are choice of language, lack of testing (permanent beta's), but also underspecified system descriptions. On the defense side static code analysis and  fuzzing has shown some success in finding security issues -- but cannot provide guarantees about the absence of errors. Stronger tools with such guarantees are formal verification of the code.",objectives the purpose of this course is to become familiar with how system vulnerabilities arise on the software layer and

Advanced algorithms,"Objectives Learn theoretical and practical principles of cyber security monitoring. Learn how to derive a threat model from complex attack scenarios. Learn how to build detection procedures fitting a given threat model. Master practical and technical aspects of state-of-the-art network, host, and log-based intrusion detection systems. Meta-objectives: Learn to structure the acquired knowledge into practical activities for training. Develop a capacity to manage and organise the work of small groups. Content The goal of this course is to provide students with a platform to get in-depth, hands-on experience on the building blocks of cyber security monitoring: network-based, host-based and log-based intrusion detection. To do so, the course is not focused on front classes but rather adopts a reverse classroom setup: the course will start by providing students with material covering practical and theoretical elements of security monitoring and additional material and pointers covering all three pillars, and their relationship. The students will then form groups, and will be able to choose one of the building blocks to explore in depth by developing a fully-fledged laboratory activity for the other students of the course to attend.

Technology and Innovation Management in Cybersecurity,"Emerging digital technologies are playing a major role in improving business efficiency and the quality of firms' offerings. Organizations collect, store and manage massive amounts of data from the installed base of physical products and users accessing their services, having to deal with the security risks and threats that digital technologies inevitably bring to the table. Undoubtedly, the digital transformation is exposing an increasing number of industries to new fragilities and risks, and requires the development of new competencies in IT governance and advanced technological solutions related to cybersecurity. Emerging technological solutions in cybersecurity have a key role in protecting organizations internally (access control systems, internal monitoring, support to decision-making processes) and in their interaction with the external environment (secure communication networks and protocols, cryptography, solutions for data protection and privacy compliance, authentication systems). Such technological solutions are based on system architectures with core technological standards and hardware and software components subject to a high rate of technical advancement and a continuous change in offerings. These conditions of high technological turbulence determine the continuous entry of new players and discontinuities in the technological landscape. From the demand side, turbulence also determines difficulties in the process of technology diffusion and on firms’ decision-making about technology adoption. Based on this vision, and in line with the evolutionary theory of the firm, the course has the objective of providing students with an academically-grounded and managerially-oriented understanding of processes and dynamics related to technology management, innovation and governance of information systems in the field of cybersecurity. The first part of the course will be dedicated to a discussion of the main concepts underlying such processes and dynamics (internal and external to the firm), which will be followed by an in-depth discussion of the processes of management of information systems, with an emphasis on strategic planning and decision-making processes in the adoption of emerging cybersecurity technological solutions, or the development of internal innovative solutions. Practical case studies will accompany lectures as examples of specific contexts where such decisions are taken, aiming at helping students understand the application of concepts to management practice. Students will be organized into groups and required to carry out a project work aimed at studying real-life cases and outlining potential technology management practices and their strategic and operational impact. At the end of the course, students will have acquired a basic competence in analyzing and managing business decisions related to information systems and cybersecurity in both strategic and operational terms. Specifically, students will understand how management decisions concerning information systems and cybersecurity can fit within the firm’s corporate and innovation strategy and will be able to analyze and orient business decisions related to such technologies.

Television Technology and Multimedia,"The central idea of the course is to help the students broaden the basic knowledge of electrical engineering, theory of the electromagnetic field, and numerical modelling with selected numerical methods. The instruction comprises the finite element method and the possibilities of its application in solving diverse problems related to the electromagnetic field. The method is introduced together with application examples of the analysis of the design of devices and components; this analysis is performed via interpreting electromagnetic fields, mainly their static, stationary, quasi-stationary, and quasi-static forms. In the course, the process of instruction is markedly supported by programs embedded within the ANSYS system (Multiphysic, Workbench, Maxwell). The teaching procedures are directed towards mastering ANSYS as a tool; the programming methods are explained and practiced, and strong points of the system are emphasized to simplify the programming. The main philosophy of ANSYS is demonstrated, with the relationship to other CAD/CAE/CAM of the SOLIDWORKS parametric system described and practiced in exercises. Thus, the course integrates the discussed aspects with the knowledge and skills acquired by the students within the BTMP subject. The practical computer training exercises have been set up to facilitate the solution of selected problems from a wide sector of electrical engineering and electronics; these exercises are performed in the ANSYS environment as a follow-up to the SOLIDWORKS 3D parametric modeler. The aim of the course is to complement the physics and mathematics-based knowledge of the field at the level of applications, namely selected numerical models of the magnetic field and various problems in electrical engineering. The course has been designed to meet the following objectives: - develop and practice the knowledge of finite numerical methods - propose and analyze different approaches to the experimental and numerical modelling of problems related to electrical engineering and electromagnetic fields - introduce to the students and explain in detail the effectiveness of ANSYS and other programs for the numerical modelling and analysis of simplified and coupled problems formulated by means of selected partial differential equations applicable in electrical engineering. These objectives are included to enable the students to independently set up, analyze and interpret a numerical model, to assess the validity of the achieved results in a comprehensive manner, and to oppose the arguments used by the submitter in the methods, interpretations, and applications of the ANSYS system or its components. The students are instructed to select conceptually correct procedures for the assigned problem, to anticipate the difficulties that may appear during the solution process, and to estimate the expected numerical error of the obtained analysis. Concrete examples are used to show how to set up or correct a model and check the correctness of the procedure, solution of the model, and interpretation of the results. The students will acquire deeper knowledge and skills within the numerical modelling of problems in electrical engineering and related interdisciplinary provinces; this knowledge acquisition process is oriented towards computer prototyping. Further, the students will gain command of the methods used for the modelling of electrical problems, and they will use their skills to set up relevant 3D models. In the above-described context, the students will be able to perform the following tasks: - reveal and discriminate the advantages of parametric and non-parametric modelling - use a suitable program to propose, design and revise models of simple problems; formulate these problems based on reduced Maxwell’s equations - interpret the physical and technical parameters of the model; categorize the classification of the model properties; set up and revise coupled problems. The above-defined skills find wide application in industry and commerce; with respect to teaching purposes, they will enable the students to carry out more intensive theoretical tasks, perform analyses, and create complex models within the follow-up advanced course of computer modelling (MMEM).  1.

Leadership in Security,"Leadership in Security is a module about taking charge of security in an organisation and driving change to improve security. This module is aimed at current or emerging security leaders, those with responsibility for directing and leading security efforts. It covers key aspects of managing people within a security team but will have value whether or not you currently lead a team. The ultimate goal is to produce professionals who can assess the current state of an organisation’s security, identify ways to improve, and deliver on those improvements. Learning Outcomes: A student successfully completing this module will gain a deeper understanding of what it takes to improve security. For those already working in security, they will be better prepared to lead parts of a security programme, or to take on more responsibility. For those moving towards security, this module will help link their prior experience with current security challenges, and assist in positioning for a lateral move into security. Indicative Module Content: Setting Direction It is impossible to drive improvement without having a clear starting point, so this module begins with taking stock and setting direction. Topics will include: - Measuring security and identifying critical gaps - Assessing risk and weighing priorities - Tracking strategic threats and maintaining situational awareness - Information security governance frameworks Managing Upwards and Outwards Modern security is a team sport, it is impossible to “win” as one person working alone in a corner. We will look at how to be an effective advocate for security inside an organisation, including: - Influencing leadership and organisational culture - Communicating security to executives - Gaining and increasing security investment - Security versus compliance (and other key alliances) Managing Security Talent Building and retaining a strong team is central to success as a security leader, yet this is an area where many struggle and few have thought deeply. We will dig deep in this area, with topics such as: - Attracting and assessing security talent - Maximising retention in security roles - Leading security professionals - Executing on a Security Programme Lastly for this module we will look at practical aspects of delivering improved security, with insights from established security leaders on how they operate and what they have learned.

Secure Software Engineering,"Incident response is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. It goes far beyond backup systems and disaster planning and involves critical reasoning and actions that can have consequences beyond the immediate incident. The course will address how threats develop, and how others have dealt with major incidents in the past. We will look at major cyber-attacks, including both commercial and military ones, and see how to draw lessons from these. The course will include an in-depth analysis of the Irish government official inquiry into the 2021 HSE cyber-attack, using the published documents as primary source. There will be at least one lecture covering the technical operation of such malware tools. The class will investigate, research on, and report back with data on current cyber-threat models. These will be discussed in open class discussion forums. There will be a realistic scenario, conducted via small groups, where student teams tackle the scenario over a tight time frame. This will account for a percentage of final grade. In addition, students maybe required to attend seminars given by security specialists. Students will maintain a learning journal addressing topics and issues that are discussed in lectures or identified by the lecturer. Learning Outcomes: - Understand the process of Incident Response - Understand how various malware tool sets work - Understand and learn from major incidents of the recent past, including both 'for profit' criminal attacks, espionage, and military attacks -

Privacy and Big Data,"Here are three reasons why you might want to take this course: First, as engineer you will be designing, implementing, or managing electronic systems and services that in most cases have privacy implications. For example, ambient sensors and biomedical implants collect, process, store, and communicate (sometimes highly sensitive) data related to individuals; the data generated by ubiquitous electronic communications provides detailed insight into people’s activities and lifestyle; and the personalization of multimedia applications and services relies on learning about individuals’ most intimate preferences and adapting to them. The first objective (O1) of the course is that you are able to identify the privacy concerns that arise in different scenarios. For example, if you are designing a new video-on-demand service for mobile phones, what could go wrong for your future users’ privacy? The second objective (O2) is that you are able to relate privacy concerns to technical design choices. For example, what privacy risks arise from relying on unique identifiers? or from centralizing the storage and processing of data? Privacy technologies aim to mitigate privacy concerns. The third objective (O3) is that you understand the principles underlying the design of privacy technologies. For example, anonymity technologies require diversity (of users, uses, attributes, internet subnets, etc.); advanced cryptographic protocols enable sophisticated services (e.g., smart metering) while minimizing the disclosure of data beyond what seems intuitively possible; and differential privacy ensures that queries to database of personal records cannot be used to determine if a particular individual record is included in the database. Second, you will deal with privacy issues not only as an engineer but also as an individual and as a member of society. As an individual, you use a variety of services: mobile communications, online shopping, search engines such as Google, social media such as Facebook or Twitter, etc. The fourth objective of this course (O4) is that you become aware of what privacy issues are associated to the use of different services, what are your basic (legal) rights concerning privacy and data protection, and what technologies you can use to mitigate your exposure to privacy risks. As a result of this, you will be able to form your own informed opinions on how privacy issues should be addressed in our increasingly technological society. Many of these privacy issues are at the heart of ongoing debates whose outcome will have an influence on how society is shaped: Is the tracking of Internet users necessary for the economic sustainability of the Internet? Might profiling and personalization lead to social sorting and discrimination? Should certain content be censored? Should we have real name policies in social media to combat harassment? Should user communications be stored for long periods of time for the purpose of law-enforcement investigations? Are we building an unprecedented mass surveillance infrastructure, or are overblown privacy concerns an obstacle to data-driven innovation? Finally, the course is heavily based on recent research. By participating in this course you will get a first hand experience of what research is like.

Design of Digital Platforms,"During the design seminar, the students will learn hands-on to select the best digital platform for a given application. It consists of the following steps: Step 1: the given application is implemented on a small micro-controller in software. This will typically be C on an 8-bit or 16-bit micro-controller. Its SW performance is measured. Step 2: the C-version is further optimized in assembly if the performance goals are not reached. This task will give them insight into performance losses due to software compilers. Step 3: students will make a HW/SW co-design project. A dedicated hardware block, either as co-processor, or instruction set extension, is made for the time critical parts of the application. Since there is a large design space, students have to choose themselves the split between HW and SW, based on the performance results obtained in the previous steps. Step 4: HW/SW co-simulation of the final design is made. And if time permits, it is downloaded on an FPGA. Step 5: Students have to present their design to their fellow students.

Development of Secure Software,"Current and future software applications, services and systems are relatively complex in nature and therefore hard to develop, deploy and evolve, especially in light of facing security threats in practice. This course studies advanced concepts in the creation and organization of complex distributed systems and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these systems in light of security and privacy. Students obtain insights, experience and capabilities that are extremely important in the study, analysis and assessment of contemporary distributed computing platforms such as – for example – cloud-based storage, large scale monitoring systems, distributed systems in automotive, highly replicated peer-2-peer systems such as block chain, etc. The course embraces some of the “killer-applications” of this time, the students learn about the trade-offs made during the engineering and deployment of such systems. The chosen platforms embed – often in production at large scale in practice – pragmatic choices that we reflect upon. This process trains the students in terms of critical reflection and evaluation. Security and privacy are the key properties being assessed; yet trade-offs with performance, availability and use-ability are an essential theme as well. The course builds upon basic knowledge in security and privacy, and on basic know in software, systems and distributed systems. The course starts form a set of introduction lectures and subsequently runs as a series of workshops where students present and analyse existing systems and services, based on seminal and ground breaking research papers.

Physical-Layer Techniques for Wireless Communication Security,"The radio channel, in particular for wireless systems, is intrinsically a shared channel, and as such it cannot guarantee security ""at its border"" like wired channels. It is therefore necessary to shift the emphasis of the channel security issues to the radio part, using the characteristics of the Physical-Layer to guarantee the security of the connection. The course has two general objectives. The first is to make the students aware of the physical part of wireless systems at the level of black-blocks and signals, and in particular of their radio link. The second is, starting from this knowledge, to provide the students with the knowledge and skills necessary to analyze the main radio techniques used to obtain secure connections, up to the basic skills needed for their dimensioning. The detailed objectives are: Knowledge and understanding: students will have to know the basic properties of wireless systems, and in particular those relating to the Physical-Layer that can be used to guarantee the security of the connection; they will also have to know the main techniques proposed to implement secure radio links. Ability to apply knowledge and understanding: at the end of the course, students must be able to make simple numerical evaluations of wireless links and to simulate at least one of the radio techniques used for security, in order to be able, in professional practice, to integrate their skills about secure computer connections, acquired in other courses, with the skills of the designers of the radio part. The planned syllabus (and an estimate of the time needed for each topic) is as follows. 1-Introduction to Wireless Systems: Black-Box description of Wireless systems, signals and protocols, radio-link budget, radio-sources and free-space propagation (lectures: 15h; exercises: 3h). 2-Wireless Indoor Propagation: propagation models and path-loss evaluation, multipath and delay spread, fading (lectures: 7h; exercises: 4h). 3-Radio-Fingerprints: Time domain fingeprints, spectral fingerprints, identification and check of wirelss fingerprints, performance indices (lectures: 5h; exercises: 2h). 4-Radio-Link reciprocity: Propagation and scattering in real environments, use of Radio-Link reciprocity for security purposes, generation and security of symmetric keys (lectures: 5h; exercises: 1h). 5-RFID and NFC: fundamentals and performances of UHF RFID and NFC systems, securty in UHF RFID, security in NFC (lectures: 9h; exercises: 3h). 6-Jamming: Fundamentals of jamming techniques

Software Reverse Engineering,"Cyber-attacks take advantage of vulnerabilities in systems and applications to compromise end users or entire systems. New vulnerabilities are being discovered every time and attackers are aware that it takes time for organizations to establish adequate protection, which has meant that security incidents have experienced a notable increase in recent years. This translates into the need to develop and maintain a digital forensics capability as part of an overall risk management framework. The study of techniques is required that make it possible to identify, preserve, analyze and present data once the attack has occurred, which in turn allows evaluating the consequences, the author, the causes, the methodology used and establishing a recovery plan and business continuity after the incident. The subject “Advanced forensic analysis” focuses on the study of methodologies and techniques to analyze the scenario once a cyber-attack has occurred. Software tools are studied that allow extracting relevant information from devices and disks without altering their content, with the aim of finding patterns, hidden information and clarifying how a certain security incident occurred. Techniques and tools from open sources for the investigation of cybercrimes are also studied.

Pros and Cons of Intelligent Systems,"Course objectives: It is a course with a motivational-methodological-paradigmatic mission to open students' thinking towards the coming era of massive use of artificial intelligence (AI) in all aspects. It is about the link between intelligence in the general sense and the design of general-purpose information processing machines (computers) with implications concerning the replacement of human cognitive activities by intelligently acting machines both in the position of cooperating with humans and as their adversaries, including implications for the cybersecurity of systems deployed so far (in both mentioned positions), but secure systems building on AI and avoiding the conflict between the goals pursued by the machine and the interests corresponding to humans. This includes fundamental ethical issues, including implications for security policies (from local to geopolitical). It broadens the technical-operational perspective of the computer-security expert, in the ability to perceive a forward-looking view and be aware of the threats and opportunities that come with AI in the world of cybersecurity.

Building Networked Systems Security,"Course contents: This course lays the foundations of digital forensics and incident response. These two areas are closely related hut still differ in key ways. Digital forensics is the use of natural science methods to answer questions that are relevant in the justice system. This can be part of a criminal investigation, but also civil recourse, e.g. through a tort. In incident response the motivation of the forensic investigations is primarily to understand how intrusions have been realized so that further exploitation can be stopped and to ensure that the attacker is not able to reestablish a foothold in the system environment after the intrusion has been eradicated. The course gives the student both practical and theoretical knowledge of technologies, methods, models, laws/rules that apply at investigations of digital crimes or incidents. For example the course covers the following: The history of forensics, Digital forensics and digital evidence, The investigation process of forensics/incident response, Legislation and international cooperations in digital forensics, Standards in the area and the requirements of an organisation that works with digital forensics or incident management, Computer forensics, Forensics for embedded systems and mobile units, Network forensics. Intended learning outcomes: After passing the course, the student should be able to: in terms of knowledge and understanding: describe central concepts, models and methods in digital forensics and incident response; describe the national and international contexts and the laws, regulations, and conventions that are negotiated within these contexts, and how these are applied both internationally and nationally; describe differences and similarities between a forensic scenario and an incident response scenario; in terms of skills and abilities: apply known methods for data collection and analysis in given situations; plan and carry out data collection and analysis, in order to run a forensic analysis or an incident analysis; present and explain conclusions from a forensic analysis; present and explain conclusions from an incident, as well as suggest future measures; in terms of judgement and approach: explain limitations with forensic analysis with regard to how certain conclusions can be drawn; explain how the previous separate between digital forensics and incident response; review critically and source-critically a forensic and incident response report; \evaluate

Foundations of Machine Learning,"Course contents: Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue performing its intended function despite of faults. In a broad sense, fault tolerance is associated with reliability, with successful operation, and with the absence of breakdowns. The ultimate goal of fault tolerance is the development of a dependable system. As computer systems become relied upon by society more and more, dependability of these systems becomes a critical issue. In airplanes, chemical plants, heart pace-makers or other safety critical applications, a system failure can cost people's lives or environmental disaster. There are various approaches to achieve fault-tolerance. Common to all these approaches is a certain amount of redundancy. This can a replicated hardware component, an additional check bit attached to a string of digital data, or a few lines of program code verifying the correctness of the program's results. In this course, we are going to study hardware as well and software fault tolerance. The rapid development of real-time computing applications that started around the mid-1990s, especially the demand for software-embedded intelligent devices, made software fault tolerance a pressing issue. The following is a tentative list of topics to be covered: Introduction; Definition of fault tolerance; Redundancy; Applications of fault-tolerance; Fundamentals of dependability; Attributes: reliability, availability, safety; Impairments: faults, errors and failures; Means: fault prevention, removal and forecasting; Dependability evaluation; Common measures: failures rate, mean time to failure, mean time to repair, etc.; Reliability block diagrams; Markov processes; Hardware redundancy; Redundancy schemes; Evaluation and comparison; Applications; Information redundancy; Codes: linear, Hamming, cyclic, unordered, arithmetic, etc.; Encoding and decoding techniques; Applications; Time redundancy; Software fault tolerance; Specific features; Software fault tolerance techniques:

Statistical Methods in Applied Computer Science,"Course contents: Reinforcement Learning (RL) addresses the problem of controlling a dynamical system so as to maximize a notion of reward cumulated over time. At each time (or round), the agent selects an action, and as a result, the system state evolves. The agent observes the new state and collects a reward associated with the state transition, before deciding on the next action. Unlike classical control tasks where typically the system dynamics are completely predictable, RL is concerned with systems whose dynamics have to be learnt or with systems interacting with an uncertain environment. As time evolves, the agent gathers more data, and may improve her knowledge about the system dynamics to make better informed decisions. RL has found numerous applications, ranging from robotics, control, online services and game playing, and has received an increasing attention. Very recently, RL has solved problems in situations approaching real-world complexity, e.g., in learning human-level control for playing video and board games. These situations are however rather specific, and we are still far from systems able to learn in a wide variety of scenarios like humans do. The course provides an in-depth treatment of the modern theoretical tools used to devise and analyse RL algorithms. It includes an introduction to RL and to its classical algorithms such as Q-learning, and SARSA, but further presents the rationale behind the design of more recent algorithms, such as those striking optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
