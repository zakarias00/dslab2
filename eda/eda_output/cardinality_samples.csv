description,735,"'This course introduces graduate students to essential topics in social science research, such as epistemology, research design and methodological choices. Students will learn basic concepts such as method, theory, paradigm and research ethics, and approaches such as positivism and post-positivism. Students will be given a comprehensive education on qualitative and quantitative research methods. Students will learn about the stages of research in social sciences. Philosophy and sociology of information, theory, positivist social science, quantitative research methods, post-positivist and critical social science, feminist and post-modern research, qualitative research methods, theory research design and method, literature review, writing strategies, research ethics, and the politics of social research. The competence objectives of this course are as follows: To understand, define and explain the basic concepts and approaches in social research, To gain the ability to use qualitative and quantitative research methods, To acquire knowledge of social research processes, To gain experience in designing social research. Course Outcomes: Based on a critical analysis, students can choose and use appropriate scientific research methods in their research activities. Students can structure and plan a research project leading to a research proposal. Students can consider and apply ethical principles in research and publication.'; 'This course aims to familiarise students with Data Science and Big Data fundamentals. Students will be trained in the skills needed to become a data scientist, including Introduction to R (Python) Programming and Advance Features in R (Python). The course introduces students to Visualization (Basic principles, ideas, and tools) and Advanced Visualization in R (Python). Exploratory Data Analysis and the Data Science Process will be presented. Basic tools (Visualization: plots and graphs and summary statistics) of EDA Using R (or Python) will be provided. Statistical Inference and Extracting Meaning from Data (Feature Generation, Feature Selection algorithms â€“ Filters; Wrappers; Decision Trees; Random Forests, Example: Churn Analysis will be taught. Three Basic Machine Learning Algorithms - Linear Regression will be presented. Ethical Issues in Data Science (Privacy, Security, and Ethics) will be introduced. Course Outcomes: Students can describe the skill sets needed to be a data scientist. Students can use R and/or Python to carry out basic statistical modeling and analysis, such as statistical Inference. Students can apply basic tools, such as plots, graphs, summary statistics, etc. for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Students can apply basic machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), k-means, Naive Bayes) for predictive modeling. Students can create effective visualizations using different packages available in both R and Python. Students can apply basic SQL commands to extract data from or run queries on a structured database. Students can understand different types of noSQL and in-memory databases and reasons of usage.'; 'Operation System (OS) purposes are resource management and the extended virtual computer, historical development. Processes are critical sections and mutual exclusion, semaphores, monitors, classical problems, deadlock, process scheduling. Input and Output: hardware and software control. Memory management: multi-programming; swapping; virtual memory, paging and symbolic segmentation; File System: operations, implementation, performance. Operating System Security and Protection Mechanisms: protection domains, access lists, capability systems, the principle of minimum privilege, security threats and attacks, encryption, and authentication. Course Outcomes: Students can understand the concepts of interrupts, memory hierarchy, cache memory, direct memory Access, multiprocessor and multicore organization. Students are able to describe the objectives and functions of the operating systems. Students have a knowledge about the evolution of the operating systems. Students can know about the developments leading to modern OS. Students can understand the concepts of virtual machines. Students are able to write bash scripts to manipulate OS.'"
